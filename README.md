Just a journal of my professional experience, tech stuff and thoughts.

You can follow this journal with [RSS](https://github.com/lucazulian/journal/releases.atom) or just checking at [releases](https://github.com/lucazulian/journal/releases).

This is yet another attempt to log my experience and thoughts in some way, so I apologize for some errors and for the future lack of perseverance.
