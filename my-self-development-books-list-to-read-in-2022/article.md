## My self-development books list to read in 2022


I would like to share with you some of the books I want to read in 2022. The motivation is the same every year but now I want to try to accomplish something more, so writing down a formal list could be the first step.

I know that this list may look quite big. I have split the books into several categories based on what I want to enhance, just to make it easier to choose what to start with based on my needs.
