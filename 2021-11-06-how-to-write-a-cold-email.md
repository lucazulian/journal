# How to write a cold email (or at least how it works for me)

In the last few weeks I've tried and experiment. I've written to a lot of interesting and notorious  people in their relative fields. 
The reason of this experiment I will explain better in the future, but one things surprised me: **ALL** have responded to my emails.

That's why I’m a big believer in cold emails. They’ve personally opened many doors for me and I believe they’re a great way to meet fun, interesting people.

Here are a few things I’ve learned so far about interesting people. I think this is almost universally true, but I admit there can be a lot of exceptional cases.

- they read their own email
- moreover, they’re good at responding to email
- they have very little time so anything with friction gets sorted into a “later” bucket

Which means a cold email, well crafted, is a great way to get attention. The magic is in writing it in a way (and having the body of work to back it up) that grabs attention.
