## How to write a cold email (or at least how it works for me)


In the last few weeks, I’ve tried an experiment. I’ve written to many exciting and notorious people in their relative field. 
I will explain the reason for this experiment better in the future, but one thing surprised me: **ALL** have responded to my emails.

That’s why I’m a big believer in cold emails. They’ve opened many doors for me, and I believe they’re a great way to meet fun, exciting people.

Here are a few things I’ve learned so far about exciting people. I think this is almost universally true, but I admit there can be a lot of exceptional cases.

- they read their email
- moreover, they’re good at responding to email
- they have very little time, so anything with friction gets sorted into a "later" bucket

This means a cold email, well crafted, is a great way to get attention. The magic is in writing it in a way (and having the body of work to back it up) that grabs attention.
I don’t have suggestions about writing an excellent cold email, but it has to be short clear on who you are and what you ask.
